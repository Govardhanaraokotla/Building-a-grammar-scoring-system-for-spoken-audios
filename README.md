Awesome! Based on the image you uploaded (`validation_scatter.png`) and the context from the code files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, etc.), it looks like you’re working on a **machine learning model to predict grammar scores from audio data**, and you're visualizing how well your predictions match the actual values.

Here’s a polished and compelling `README.md` tailored to your current project setup:

# 🧠 Grammar Score Predictor for Spoken Audio

A Machine Learning project to **predict grammar scores** from spoken audio using deep learning and natural language processing. This project involves preprocessing audio files, extracting features, training a regression model, and visualizing prediction performance.

## 📊 Sample Result

</p>

**Insight**: As seen above, the model predicts grammar scores fairly consistently across various true values — indicating a bias in output (potential improvement point!).

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- 🎧 **Audio Preprocessing**: Feature extraction from `.wav` files using `librosa` and `torchaudio`.
- 🔍 **Feature Engineering**: Use of spectral features and embeddings for model training.
- 🧠 **Model Training**: Regression model built with `PyTorch` to predict grammar scores.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Scatter plots and scoring metrics for validation.
- 📦 **Submission**: CSV output aligned with competition-style format.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Add your `.wav` or `.mp3` audio files (if not using existing metadata).
2. Run the feature extraction and model training code.
3. Evaluate performance using scatter plots or regression metrics.
4. Generate `submission.csv` for prediction output.

audio_001.wav,3.64
audio_002.wav,3.64
audio_003.wav,3.64
...
```
